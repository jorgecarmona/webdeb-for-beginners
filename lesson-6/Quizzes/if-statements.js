 * Declare a const named initialValue and set its value to 10.
 */

/**
 * Question 2
 * Declare a let variable named result and set its initial value to 0.

/**
 * Question 3
 * Using an if statement, check if initialValue is greater than 5. If true, set result to initialValue times 2.
 */

/**
 * Question 4
 * Declare an array named numbers containing the first five prime numbers.

/**
 * Question 5
 * If the fifth value in the numbers array is greater than initialValue, add 5 to result.
 */

/**
 * Question 6
 * Declare an object named settings with two properties: theme set to "light" and notifications set to true.
 */

/**
 * Question 7
 * Using an if statement, if notifications property is true, add 3 to result.
 */

/**
 * Question: 8
 * Change the theme property of settings to "dark".
